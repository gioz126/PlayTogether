# Play Together

## What will the application do?
I want to make an application where users can **book sport courts** (mainly racket sport, such as badminton), **open play** (users can play together with other users that uses the application), **create / join sport community** (users can create sport community based on its' sport and other users can join the community). 

To be able to book sport courts, we need owners of the court (cooperate with courts' owners). If this works well, I will get an admin-fee for users who book courts through the application.

## Who will use it?
1. Users who have **hobby of playing racket sports** and are **lazy to call** the courts' owner/management.
2. Users who **wants to play** racket sport but **don't have any friends to play with**.

## Why is this project interest you
I am interested with this project because I am fond of playing badminton but hard to get court since I need to call the court management team first to book the court and I am an university student whose time is pretty limited. Furthermore, since moving to Canada, I don't really have much friends to play badminton with, therefore with one of the application's function to have a community / join a game, I can join a community / join a game in which I am interested in (in this case, badminton community / badminton game).

## Bonus functions that might be added
* Competition
* Sparring
